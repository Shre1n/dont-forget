Saphira: Ah, my dear.[wait=1] You’ve finally arrived. I've been waiting for this moment for far longer than you can imagine.
Saphira: The world you see now is but a fragile shadow of what it once was. Time itself has fallen out of balance.
Saphira: Drexus, the Timekeeper...[wait=2] once a guardian, now a tyrant of time. He was created to protect the flow of past,[wait=1] present[wait=1], and future,[wait=1] but his purpose twisted. The weight of eternity shattered his soul.
Saphira: He hides in the mystical cave, the heart of time's magic, where he seeks to reshape the very fabric of existence.
Saphira: Your brother… yes,[wait=1] the child he took. It wasn’t an act of cruelty, but a desperate attempt to manipulate you. Drexus sees you as a danger, an anomaly in his perfect vision of time.
Saphira: But you, my dear, are not a threat. You are the key. Your bond with time is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. The power within you can undo the chaos Drexus has unleashed.
Saphira: Go now, and remember: the path forward is not just a battle against Drexus. It is a journey to understand yourself and the bond you share with the flow of time. Only then will you be able to reclaim your brother... and restore balance.
