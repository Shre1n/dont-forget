Elder Saphira: [wait=10]Listen carefully, my child. [wait=2]There are things you must know. Our village carries a great responsibility, one far greater than most can comprehend. [wait=4]For generations, we have watched over the cave at the edge of our home. 
Elder Saphira: A place that is more than just rock and shadow. [wait=1] It is a nexus of temporal magic, [wait=1]a source of ancient power that maintains the balance of the world.
Elder Saphira: [wait=1]But the stories, once our shield, have lost their weight. [wait=3]The villagers see them as mere myths, yet I tell you [wait=0.5]they are true. [wait=1]And now, with the cave stirring once more, it is clear how dangerous it is to lose sight of time.
Elder Saphira: [wait=3]Within the cave dwells Drexus. He was once a guardian of balance, [wait=1]a mighty being created by the flow of time itself. 
Elder Saphira: [wait=2]His task was to preserve the course of time, [wait=0.5]ensuring that past, [wait=0.5]present, and future flowed in harmony. [wait=0.5]He walked the planes of reality, correcting disruptions and guarding the order of time. [wait=1]But this duty was a burden. [wait=2]With every intervention, the weight grew heavier, [wait=0.5]until it became unbearable.
Elder Saphira: [wait=1]In the end, Drexus succumbed to his own power. He no longer sought to protect – he sought to dominate. [wait=1]Time itself was to bend to his will. 
Elder Saphira: He discovered the cave, [wait=0.3]a source of immense temporal magic, [wait=0.3]and made it his fortress. But this power was a curse. 
Elder Saphira: [wait=1]Drexus lost his humanity, [wait=0.5]becoming a being trapped between seconds and ages, [wait=1]unable to ever experience the present again. [wait=1.5]He has remained there for millennia, but now his strength seems to be growing. [wait=1]Magical creatures that once lurked deep within the cave are venturing out. [wait=1]Our village is no longer safe.
Elder Saphira: [wait=1.5]And then… [wait=0.5]there is your brother. [wait=0.5]Even if he may not understand his abilities, [wait=0.3]his pure, [wait=0.3]innocent nature has drawn Drexus’ attention. [wait=1]Your brother carries something with him that is of immeasurable value to Drexus. [wait=1]Something that could help him escape his confinement. Drexus has taken him, 
Elder Saphira: And now your brother is held captive within the cave. [wait=1.5]Listen well, child. [wait=0.8]Your heart may be strong, [wait=0.5] but time is deceitful. Trust your instincts, but beware of the shadows that hunt you. [wait=0.5]It is up to you to restore balance [wait=0.5]– and to save your brother. You are not like others.
Elder Saphira: Your magic, your connection to time, makes you special. [wait=1]It mirrors the powers Drexus once wielded before his fall. [wait=0.5]You must understand and learn how to harness them. [wait=2]In the cave, time behaves differently. [wait=1]It will confuse you, try to mislead you. Yet, if you are wise, [wait=0.5]it can also be your ally. Your mission is clear you must find your brother and bring him back. 
Elder Saphira: Learn all you can, but do not waste time. Stay vigilant – not everything is as it seems. [wait=1]You are our hope, [wait=0.5]not just for your brother, [wait=0.5]but for the balance of the world. [wait=1.5]I can offer guidance if you lose your way, but this path is yours to walk alone. [wait=0.3]Hurry, my child. [wait=1]Time is running out.
